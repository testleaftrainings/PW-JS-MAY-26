# 🚀 Playwright Day 13 – API Integration with Playwright

Welcome to **Day 13** of the Playwright learning series.

This repository focuses on **API Testing using Playwright**, covering REST API fundamentals, ServiceNow integration, HTTP requests, response validation, and API automation best practices.

---

## 📖 Overview

Playwright is more than a browser automation framework—it provides built-in support for testing REST APIs through the `APIRequestContext`.

This repository demonstrates how to perform API testing using Playwright by integrating with **ServiceNow REST APIs**, validating responses, chaining API requests, and applying industry-standard API testing practices.

## 🚀 API Concepts Covered

| Category | Topics |
|----------|--------|
| HTTP | Methods, Headers, Status Codes |
| REST API | CRUD Operations |
| ServiceNow | Table API |
| Request | URL, Headers, Body, Parameters |
| Response | Status, Headers, Body |
| Validation | Assertions & Best Practices |

---

## 🔄 CRUD Operations

| Operation | HTTP Method |
|-----------|-------------|
| Create | POST |
| Read | GET |
| Update | PUT / PATCH |
| Delete | DELETE |

---

## 🛠 Common Playwright API Methods

- `request.get()`
- `request.post()`
- `request.put()`
- `request.patch()`
- `request.delete()`

---

## ✅ Response Validation

The repository demonstrates validation of:

- HTTP Status Codes
- Response Headers
- Response Body
- Field Values
- Data Types
- Arrays
- Objects
- Business Rules

---

## 🔗 API Workflow

```text
Create Record
      │
      ▼
Retrieve Record
      │
      ▼
Update Record
      │
      ▼
Delete Record
```

---

## 📚 Best Practices

- Validate status codes before parsing the response.
- Verify response headers and body.
- Use `sys_id` for ServiceNow record operations.
- Store reusable values for API chaining.
- Separate test data from test logic.
- Keep API tests independent and maintainable.

---

## ▶️ Getting Started

Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Run all API tests

```bash
npx playwright test
```

Run a specific API test

```bash
npx playwright test tests/api.spec.ts
```

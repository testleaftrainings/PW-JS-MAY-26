## 🎯 Learning Objectives

After completing this session, you will be able to:

- Understand Browser Context in Playwright
- Persist authentication using `storageState()`
- Differentiate Local Storage, Session Storage, and Cookies
- Access browser storage using `page.evaluate()`
- Organize Playwright tests using `test.describe()`
- Use annotations, tags, and hooks effectively
- Follow enterprise-level test organization practices

## 💻 Key Concepts

### Authentication Persistence

- Save authenticated browser state using `storageState()`
- Reuse login sessions across multiple test cases
- Reduce execution time by avoiding repeated logins

### Browser Storage

- Local Storage
- Session Storage
- Cookies

### Test Organization

- `test.describe()`
- `test.step()`
- Hooks
- Tags
- Annotations

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Playwright
- TypeScript
- Node.js

## ▶️ Run the Tests

Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Run all tests

```bash
npx playwright test
```

Run a specific test

```bash
npx playwright test tests/example.spec.ts
```

Run Smoke Tests

```bash
npx playwright test --grep @smoke
```

## 📚 Best Practices

- Reuse authentication using Storage State
- Group related tests with `test.describe()`
- Use hooks for setup and cleanup
- Organize tests using tags and annotations
- Keep tests independent and maintainable
